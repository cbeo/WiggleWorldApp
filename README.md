# Wiggle World

Wiggle World is just a toy about shape and motion. I thought of it one
day while watching ducks and turtles at a local pond.  As the ducks
emerged from the water, their butts would wiggle back and forth
without the rest of their body seeming to move. As turtles sank deeper
into the water, I noticed that their features faded as the depth
increased. Eventually I could see only vague blobs drifting in and out
of patches of light.  

Shapes and light and motion.  I thought might be fun to draw some
shapes and whatch them drift and shift and wiggle.  So that's what
does.

Hope you [enjoy it](https://cbeo.github.io/wiggle-world)!
