# Wiggle World

Wiggle World is just a toy about shape and motion. I thought of it one
day while watching ducks and turtles at a local pond.  

As ducks emerged from the water, their butts would wiggle back and
forth, seemingly independant of the rest of their bodies. If you've
ever seen a duck shake off some damp, you'll know what I mean.

As turtles sank deeper into the water, I noticed that their features
faded as their depths increased. Eventually, I could see only vague
blobs with stumpy limbs drifting in and out through patches of light.  

Shapes and light and motion are what I was watching that day at the
pond.  I thought might be fun to make a toy that lets a person draw
some shapes in order to watch them drift and shift and wiggle.  So
that's what Wiggle World does.

Hope you [enjoy it](https://cbeo.github.io/wiggle-world)!
