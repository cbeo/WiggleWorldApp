# Wiggle World

Is just a toy.  I thought about it one day watching turtles and ducks
in pond at the park. I noticed how, when the turtles were deep enough,
I couldn't quite see their features, just their shapes as they drifted
about.  Then I thought, wouldn't it be kinda fun to just draw a shape
and watch it wiggle?

Hope you [enjoy it](https://cbeo.github.io/wiggle-world)!
