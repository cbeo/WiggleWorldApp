# Wiggle World

Is just a toy.  I thought about it one day while watching turtles and
ducks coasting about in a pond. I noticed how, when the turtles were
deep enough, I couldn't quite see their features, just their shapes as
they drifted about.  Then I thought, wouldn't it be kinda fun to just
draw a shape and watch it wiggle?

Hope you [enjoy it](https://cbeo.github.io/wiggle-world)!
